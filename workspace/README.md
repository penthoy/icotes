# Features at a glance #

## Agent Creator ##
This is the default selected agent. It's a custom agent, and the code lives at
`workspace/.icotes/plugins/agent_creator_agent.py`. You can modify any part of it to fit your needs.

The `MODEL_NAME` defaults to `gpt-5-nano`. To use a more capable model, change the `MODEL_NAME`
constant in the agent implementation or configure it via your environment/runtime settings.

## Features ##
Fully working Editor, Terminal and AI agent that can do CRUD operations on the
File system level, Agent can also run terminal commands and edit any files.

# Index #
Both the frontend and backend cores are designed as standalone frameworks, with
middleware/glue code that connects them for flexibility.

## ICUI ##
This is the main frontend framework used for the UI.
It is designed to be flexible and modular. The arrangement of panels can be reconfigured
with a JSON file.

## ICPY ##
This is the Python/FastAPI backend that powers everything behind the scenes.
It is named ICPY with the intent to explore portions in faster frameworks
such as Rust or Go later on.

## Hot reload ##
To add or update an agent:
1) Create `<AgentName>_agent.py` under the `workspace/.icotes/plugins` folder.
2) Register it in `.icotes/agents.json`.
3) The hot-reload system will pick it up automatically, or click the reload button next to the Agent
   selector in the Chat window to force a reload.
You can use your updated agent immediately after reload.
