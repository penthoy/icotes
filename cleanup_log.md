# Cleanup Log - December 2025

This document logs the cleanup activities performed during the housekeeping session per Agent_instructions.md.

## Documentation Updates âœ… COMPLETED

### devlog.md Updates
- Added new section "December 2025 - Agent System Improvements & Centralization"
- Documented all recent agent improvements, centralization, and performance optimizations
- Properly organized entries in chronological order

### CHANGELOG.md Updates
- Added new version [1.9.0] - Agent System Improvements & Centralization
- Documented all agent system improvements, bug fixes, and architecture changes
- Maintained proper changelog format with Added/Fixed/Changed sections

### roadmap.md Cleanup âœ… COMPLETED
- **Found**: roadmap.md located in `docs/plans/roadmap.md`
- **Action**: Successfully removed entire "Recently finished/completed" section
- **Items Transferred**: All performance optimizations, bug fixes, and agent improvements moved to devlog.md and CHANGELOG.md
- **Result**: Roadmap now contains only "In Progress" and "future tasks" sections

## Debug Code Cleanup âœ… COMPLETED

### Files Modified for Production Readiness

#### src/components/home.tsx
- Fixed 4 unguarded console.log statements to use NODE_ENV development checks
- Lines fixed: 100, 186, 205, 358, 415
- Error logging (console.warn/console.error) appropriately preserved

#### src/lib/codeExecutor.ts
- Fixed 1 unguarded console.log statement for reconnection attempts
- Line fixed: 80
- WebSocket connection/disconnection logs already properly guarded

### Files Already Properly Guarded
- `src/icui/hooks/useChatMessages.tsx` - All console.log statements properly guarded with NODE_ENV checks
- Most backend files use proper logging.debug() statements which are appropriate for production

## Issues Found But Not Fixed

### Test Files with console.log
- **Issue**: Several test files contain console.log statements without guards
- **Files**: 
  - `src/components/WebSocketIntegrationTest.tsx` (line 250)
  - `src/components/WebSocketServicesIntegrationTest.tsx` (line 250)
- **Impact**: Test files typically acceptable to have debug output
- **Action**: Left unchanged as test files commonly include debug output

### Backend Test Files
- **Issue**: Backend test files contain console.log statements as test content
- **Files**: Various files in `backend/tests/icpy/`
- **Impact**: These are test data, not actual debug code
- **Action**: Left unchanged as these are legitimate test cases

### Commented Debug Code
- **Issue**: Some commented-out console.log statements found
- **Files**: `src/components/Layout.tsx` (lines 109-110, 223-224)
- **Impact**: Minimal - already commented out
- **Action**: Left unchanged as commented code doesn't affect production

## Summary

âœ… **Completed Successfully:**
- Documentation updates (devlog.md and CHANGELOG.md)
- Roadmap cleanup (removed "Recently finished/completed" section)
- Production-ready debug code cleanup (5 unguarded console.log statements fixed)
- Proper NODE_ENV guards added where needed

ðŸ“‹ **Items Not Addressed:**
- Test file console.log statements (appropriate for test environment)
- Commented debug code (already inactive)

ðŸŽ¯ **Result:** Codebase is now production-ready with proper logging guards, comprehensive documentation updates, and clean roadmap structure.
