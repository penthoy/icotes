  - **Result**: Users can now drag and drop editor file tabs to reorder them

### Terminal Scrolling Fix Implementation
- **Terminal Scrolling Issue Resolution** ✅
  - **Issue**: Terminal panels showed black areas instead of scrollable content when commands produced large outputs (e.g., `history` command)
  - **Root Cause**: Fundamental mismatch between xterm.js viewport sizing and container layout, preventing proper scrollbar display
  - **Solution**: Complete rewrite of terminal implementation based on code-server analysis
  - **Implementation**: 
    - Created `ICUITerminalPanelFromScratch.tsx` with proper code-server patterns
    - Added `icuiTerminaltest.tsx` integration test component (accessible at `/icui-terminal-test`)
    - Used proper xterm.css viewport classes with `overflow-y: scroll` on `.xterm-viewport`
    - Implemented FitAddon with correct initialization order (open terminal BEFORE fitting)
    - Added ResizeObserver for dynamic container size changes
    - Applied critical CSS for viewport scrolling control
  - **Key Changes**:
    - Imported `@xterm/xterm/css/xterm.css` first before custom CSS
