# ICP Backend Implementation Plan (icpi_plan3)

## Overview
This document outlines a modular, event-driven backend architecture for the iLaborCode project, designed to support both UI and CLI interactions while maintaining flexibility for future expansion. The architecture is inspired by the UI rewrite plan and the agent-backend-guide, focusing on a clean, maintainable structure with clear separation of concerns.

## Core Principles

1. **Unified API Layer**: Single interface for both UI and CLI interactions
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling between components through events
3. **Modular Design**: Independent, swappable components
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based communication for live updates
5. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage for each component
6. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout the codebase

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### 1.1 Message Broker System
- **Purpose**: Central communication hub for all backend services
- **Components**:
  - Event bus implementation using RxJS for reactive programming
  - Topic-based subscription system
  - Message validation and routing
  - Error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Basic pub/sub functionality
  - Message routing
  - Error conditions and recovery

### 1.2 API Gateway
- **Purpose**: Single entry point for all client connections
- **Components**:
  - WebSocket server for real-time communication
  - REST endpoints for traditional HTTP requests
  - Authentication and authorization layer
  - Request/response transformation
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Connection management
  - Authentication flows
  - Message forwarding to services

### 1.3 Service Registry
- **Purpose**: Dynamic service discovery and lifecycle management
- **Components**:
  - Service registration/deregistration
  - Health monitoring
  - Load balancing (future)
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Service discovery
  - Health check endpoints
  - Failure scenarios

## Phase 2: Core Services

### 2.1 Workspace Service
- **Purpose**: Manage the current workspace state
- **Features**:
  - Track open files and editors
  - Manage workspace settings
  - Handle file system watching
- **Integration Tests**:
  - File state tracking
  - Workspace configuration
  - Change notifications

### 2.2 File System Service
- **Purpose**: Abstract file system operations
- **Features**:
  - Cross-platform file operations
  - File watching
  - Virtual file system support
- **Integration Tests**:
  - CRUD operations
  - File watching
  - Error handling

### 2.3 Terminal Service
- **Purpose**: Manage terminal instances
- **Features**:
  - PTY management
  - Terminal sessions
  - Process management
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Terminal creation/destruction
  - Input/output handling
  - Process lifecycle

## Phase 3: Integration Layer

### 3.1 Editor Integration
- **Purpose**: Bridge between editor and backend services
- **Features**:
  - Document synchronization
  - Language server protocol (LSP) integration
  - Code intelligence
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Document sync
  - LSP communication
  - Code actions

### 3.2 AI Agent Integration
- **Purpose**: Enable AI-powered features
- **Features**:
  - Tool calling interface
  - Context management
  - Response streaming
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Tool execution
  - Context management
  - Streaming responses

## Phase 4: Client Libraries

### 4.1 Web Client
- **Purpose**: Browser-based client
- **Features**:
  - WebSocket communication
  - State management
  - UI integration

### 4.2 CLI Client
- **Purpose**: Command-line interface
- **Features**:
  - Command parsing
  - Output formatting
  - Interactive mode

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between components
- Use real services with in-memory implementations where possible
- Focus on happy paths and common error cases

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user flows
- Use a real browser for web client tests
- Test CLI commands in a real terminal

## Future Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Implement request batching
- Add caching layers
- Optimize data structures

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of services
- Distributed message brokers
- Load balancing

### Extensibility
- Plugin system for custom features
- Webhook support
- Third-party integrations

## Implementation Notes

1. Start with the core infrastructure (Phase 1)
2. Implement basic services (Phase 2)
3. Add integration layers (Phase 3)
4. Build client libraries (Phase 4)
5. Iterate based on feedback and testing

This plan provides a solid foundation for building a flexible, maintainable backend that can evolve with the project's needs. Each phase builds on the previous one, allowing for incremental development and testing.
