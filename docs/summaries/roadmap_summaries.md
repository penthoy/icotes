  - Event-driven communication through message broker integration.
  - Multiple terminal instances with independent sessions.
  - Terminal session lifecycle management (create, start, stop, destroy).
  - WebSocket connection handling for real-time I/O.
  - Google-style docstrings for all methods.

### File System Service
- **Task**: Implemented comprehensive file system service with event-driven architecture.
- **Key Features**:

  - File watching with watchdog for real-time change detection.
  - File search and indexing capabilities with content search.
  - Event-driven architecture with message broker integration.
  - Google-style docstrings for all methods.

### Workspace Service
- **Task**: Implemented workspace service for application state management.
- **Key Features**:
  - Complete workspace state management (files, panels, terminals, layouts).
  - Workspace creation, loading, switching, and persistence.
  - Event-driven architecture with message broker integration.
  - Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### Connection Manager and API Gateway
- **Task**: Implemented connection management and API gateway infrastructure.
- **Key Features**:
  - Connection lifecycle management for WebSocket, HTTP, and CLI connections.
  - API Gateway as single entry point for all client communications.
  - FastAPI integration for HTTP/WebSocket endpoints.
  - Comprehensive JSON-RPC handler registration.
  - Statistics and monitoring for all connections.

### JSON-RPC Protocol Definition
- **Task**: Implemented JSON-RPC protocol infrastructure for standardized communication.
- **Key Features**:
  - Complete JSON-RPC 2.0 specification support with ICPY extensions.
  - Request/response/notification/batch processing.
  - Middleware support for request processing pipeline.
  - Protocol versioning for future compatibility.
  - Google-style docstrings for all methods.

### Message Broker Implementation
- **Task**: Implemented core message broker infrastructure for ICPY backend.
- **Key Features**:
  - In-memory event bus using asyncio.Queue and asyncio.Event.
  - Topic-based subscription system with wildcard patterns.
  - Request/response and notification patterns.
  - Message persistence and replay for client recovery.
  - Google-style docstrings for all methods.

### Terminal Clipboard Implementation (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: Terminal copy/paste functionality not working despite multiple implementation attempts.
- **Previous Attempts Made**:
  1. Context menu with clipboard addon.
  2. Auto-copy on selection with context menu.
  3. Simplified keyboard shortcuts only.
- **Previous Root Cause**: Browser security restrictions prevent clipboard API access in current development environment.
- **Resolution**: Implemented backend-based clipboard via existing server endpoints (POST /clipboard, GET /clipboard).
- **Status**: RESOLVED - SimpleTerminal now has working copy/paste functionality.
- **Implementation**: Uses server-side clipboard with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+C/V).
- **Documentation**: See SimpleTerminal implementation in `tests/integration/simpleterminal.tsx`.

### Backend Architecture Plan Synthesis
- **Task**: Synthesized three separate backend architecture plans (icpi_plan1.md, icpi_plan2.md, icpi_plan3.md) into a comprehensive unified plan.
- **Key Features**:
  - Unified API layer supporting WebSocket, HTTP, and CLI interfaces.
  - Event-driven architecture with message broker for real-time updates.
  - Modular services (Workspace, FileSystem, Terminal, AI Agent integration).
  - Support for commands like `icotes file.py` to open files in editor.
  - Real-time synchronization across all connected clients.
  - Extensible design for future rich text editor and AI agent features.
- **Status**: Complete - ready for review and implementation planning.
