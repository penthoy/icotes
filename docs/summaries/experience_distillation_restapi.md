- **To**: Modular event-driven architecture with clear service boundaries
- **Structure Created**:
  ```
  backend/icpy/
  ├── core/           # Infrastructure (message broker, protocol, connections)
  ├── services/       # Business logic (workspace, filesystem, terminal)
  ├── api/           # Interface layer (WebSocket, REST)
  ├── gateway/       # Client routing and management
  └── tests/         # Comprehensive integration tests (184 tests total)
  ```

### Event-Driven Architecture Success
- **Message Broker**: Central nervous system for all service communication

### Service Pattern Consistency
- **Factory Pattern**: `get_*_service()` functions for service initialization
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper startup/shutdown with resource cleanup
- **Event Publishing**: All services publish events for state changes
- **Async/Await**: Consistent async patterns throughout the codebase

### Code Standards Observed
- **Google-style docstrings** are mandatory for all new methods and classes

## Critical Mistakes and Lessons Learned

### 1. Import Name Assumptions (Multiple Phases)
**Mistake**: Repeatedly assumed service class names without verification
- **Example**: `FilesystemService` vs `FileSystemService` (actual)
- **Impact**: Import errors requiring multiple debugging cycles
- **Lesson**: Always use `grep_search` to verify actual class/function names before implementation
- **Fix**: Developed habit of checking imports before writing code

### 2. Test Framework Complexity (Phase 3.2)
**Mistake**: Spent excessive time debugging pytest/FastAPI TestClient compatibility
- **Example**: TestClient initialization issues with async services
- **Impact**: Delayed verification of REST API functionality
- **Lesson**: Create minimal test scripts first to isolate functionality from framework issues
- **Fix**: Built `test_rest_api_simple.py` to verify core functionality

### 3. Service Lifecycle Management (Phase 2.3)
**Mistake**: Initially forgot proper service shutdown in some implementations
- **Example**: Terminal service not properly cleaning up PTY sessions
- **Impact**: Resource leaks and potential memory issues
- **Lesson**: Always implement proper `shutdown()` methods with resource cleanup
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive lifecycle management with timeout handling

### 4. Documentation Debt (Early Phases)
**Mistake**: Initially implemented code without comprehensive docstrings
- **Example**: Early service methods lacked Google-style docstrings
- **Impact**: Reduced code maintainability and team collaboration
- **Lesson**: Write Google-style docstrings during implementation, not after
- **Fix**: Established pattern of docstring-first development

### 5. Event System Complexity (Phase 1.1)
**Mistake**: Over-engineered message broker with unnecessary features initially
- **Example**: Complex message persistence before understanding actual needs
- **Impact**: Increased development time and potential bugs
- **Lesson**: Start with simple implementation and add complexity based on real needs
- **Fix**: Iteratively enhanced message broker based on service requirements

- **Impact**: Loose coupling and natural scalability

### 4. Service Factory Pattern
**Pattern**: Consistent `get_*_service()` functions for all services
- **Approach**: Singleton pattern with proper lifecycle management
- **Success**: Easy service initialization and dependency injection
