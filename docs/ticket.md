The catch-all route @app.get("/{path:path}") is intercepting /api/files requests and serving the React HTML instead of letting the API routes handle them!

This is a common FastAPI issue where the catch-all route for serving the SPA (Single Page App) intercepts API routes. The catch-all route needs to be registered AFTER all the API routes, but here it's probably being registered AFTER the icpy REST API routes.

pkill -f "python.*uvicorn" || echo "No server running"
cd /home/penthoy/ilaborcode/backend && python3 -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

I see there's a warning about icpy modules not being available due to a pydantic version issue. This means the REST API might not be getting registered. Let me check if we can still access the API endpoint:
