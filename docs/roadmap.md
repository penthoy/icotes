# JavaScript Code Editor - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
A web-based JavaScript code editor built with React, CodeMirror 6, and modern web technologies. The goal is to create a powerful, user-friendly code editor with real-time execution capabilities.

## Recently Finished

### Theme System Refinements - COMPLETED ✅
- **Fixed Active Tab Styling**: Active tabs now use lighter colors instead of darker ones for better visual hierarchy

- **Fixed Dividers**: All dividers and borders now use theme-aware colors (`--icui-border-subtle`)
- **Improved Scrollbar Readability**: 
  - Increased scrollbar size from 8px to 12px for better visibility
  - Used specific colors for dark themes (#6e7681) and light themes (#d0d7de)
  - Added proper hover states and border styling
- **Fixed Panel Area Theming**: All panel components (headers, content areas) now use CSS variables consistently
- **Fixed Panel Selector Theming**: Dropdown and buttons now use proper theme colors with hover states
