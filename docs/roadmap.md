# JavaScript Code Editor - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
A web-based JavaScript code editor built with React, CodeMirror 6, and modern web technologies. The goal is to create a powerful, user-friendly code editor with real-time execution capabilities.

## In Progress ðŸš§
- [] icui-enhanced: using this to add features to icui

## Future tasks:
-[] ICUI 4.5 feedbacks:
Great work on the minimalist implementation, this is great, lets now add in some essential features back in bit by bit, be very aware that we're still trying to get this as light as possible, for icui-main, ICUITest45 and ICUIReferenceLayouts, 
1. we still want resizable edges on all the panels.
2. while minimalistic, we still want tabs for script editor and syntax highlighting line number()
3. dragable panels similar to icui-test3, these features should be made relatively easy to implement on the implementation itself, and the heavy lifting should be inside the abstraction of the framework itself, if you think these feature require too much code to implement inside these files, then delegate them into the framework, using this as an opportunity to develope the framework.
4. lastly for these implementations the bottom edge should be sticking to the bottom of the browser(see screenshot), and it should stretch according to the edge of the browser, if the edge is squeezed/squashed, make sure there are scroll bars on all the windows to accomodate the squeeze, and the panel window should not grow bigger if its content inside got bigger, such as chat panel got more chat content, the scroll bar length should grow instead. 

Every feature mentioned here are the most basic features essential for this frame work, if they're require too much code to implement abstract them into the framework itself which should do the heavy lifting.

- [] Continue with icui_rewrite.md on step 5 (Modular Menu System), implementing top menu bar and file/layout menus
1. rename the current home route / and rewrite a new home page base

- [] create an backend state api layer that is the center of truth for all windows, such as explorer and editor.
- [] Cleanup: remove anything under the following directories so that tempo templates are removed if they are not being used in this repo: src/components/stories src/components/ui src/components, first create a refactor.md under docs, put in all the names of the files that is marked for removal, and wait for my approval, once I reviewed them and approved goahead and remove them.
- [] change the project name from ilabor code to icotes(AI + code + notes)
- [] Backend: refactor the main.py and create a terminal.py move everything terminal related from main.py to terminal.py so that it is more modular.
- [] Add agent chat tab on the left side same place as the Explorer with a tab, similar to how vs code extensions are installed on the left side.

### Priority 2: Enhanced Editor
1. Add search and replace functionality
2. Implement code formatting options
3. Add more language support beyond JavaScript
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Architecture Notes

### Key Components
- `Home.tsx`: Main application container and state management
- `CodeEditor.tsx`: CodeMirror 6 wrapper with custom extensions
- `OutputPanel.tsx`: Execution results and error display
- `FileTabs.tsx`: File management and tabbed interface
- `ThemeToggle.tsx`: Theme switching functionality

### State Management
- Currently using React useState for local state
- Consider implementing Context API or Zustand for complex state
- File management state needs centralized handling

### Performance Considerations
- CodeMirror 6 handles large files efficiently
- Output panel should limit displayed logs to prevent memory issues
- Consider virtualization for file lists in future file explorer
