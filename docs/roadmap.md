# JavaScript Code Editor - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
A web-based JavaScript code editor built with React, CodeMirror 6, and modern web technologies. The goal is to create a powerful, user-friendly code editor with real-time execution capabilities.

## In Progress
- [ ] one last last test
## Recently Finished
- [x] **New ICUIEnhancedEditorPanel.tsx - Combined Implementation** ✅
  - **Combined Best Features**: Created new ICUIEnhancedEditorPanel.tsx that combines:
    - Excellent syntax highlighting and CodeMirror setup from ICUIEditorPanelFromScratch.tsx
    - Full tabs functionality for multiple files
    - Complete ICUI framework integration using CSS variables
  - **Framework Abstraction**: Created `src/icui/utils/syntaxHighlighting.ts` utility to abstract reusable parts:
    - `createICUISyntaxHighlighting()` function for consistent syntax highlighting
    - `createICUIEditorTheme()` function for ICUI-themed CodeMirror styles
    - `getLanguageExtension()` function for dynamic language loading
  - **Enhanced Features**: The new implementation includes:
    - Tabs functionality with file switching, close buttons, and creation
    - Modified file indicators and auto-save support
    - Proper theme detection and CSS variable integration
    - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S to save, Ctrl+Enter to run)
    - Clean, minimal architecture following ICUI patterns
  - **Updated Test Integration**: Updated ICUITestEnhanced.tsx to use the new implementation
  - **Maintained Compatibility**: Preserved all existing interfaces and functionality
- [x] update icui_rewrite for 4.9: create a editor rewrite that is from scratch, the previous editor(ICUIEnhancedEditorPanelOld.tsx) was importing from the CodeEditor.tsx and had some longstanding issues, that we couldn't solve, so now we'll rewrite it from scratch. please only edit icui_rewrite and stop for my approval before proceeding
### CodeEditor Background & Divider Improvements - COMPLETED ✅
**Issue**: Code Editor unused/empty space remained bright white even in dark themes, and dividers were too bright.

**Solution**:
- **Fixed CodeEditor Background**: Added explicit dark background styling (`#1e1e1e`) to both container and editor areas
- **Enhanced Panel Integration**: Wrapped CodeEditor components with proper theme-aware background containers
- **Dimmed Divider Colors**: Reduced brightness of border colors in dark themes:
  - GitHub Dark: borders now use `#30363d` and `#21262d` (much dimmer)
  - Monokai: borders now use `#3e3d32` and `#2f3129` (subtle)
  - One Dark: borders now use `#3e4451` and `#2c313c` (appropriate contrast)
- **Consistent Dark Experience**: All editor areas now maintain dark backgrounds without white spaces

**Components Updated**:
- `CodeEditor.tsx`: Added explicit theme-based background styling
- `ICUIEnhancedEditorPanel.tsx`: Wrapped CodeEditor with theme containers
- `ICUIEditorPanel.tsx`: Added proper background containers
- `icui-themes.css`: Dimmed all dark theme border colors

### Critical Bug Fix - Panel Management - COMPLETED ✅
**Issue**: Dynamic panels disappeared when switching tabs in Code Editor, causing infinite tab switching loops.

**Root Cause**: The `useEffect` hook that initialized panels was running every time editor files changed, completely resetting the panels array and removing dynamically added panels.

**Solution**: 
- **Separated Panel Initialization**: Initial panels now created only once on component mount
- **Dynamic Content Updates**: Editor panel content updates without resetting entire panels array 
- **Fixed Panel Type Matching**: Content updates now affect all editor panels (initial + dynamically added)
- **Preserved Panel State**: Dynamically added panels now persist across tab switches

**Tests to Verify Fix**:
1. ✅ Add panel via dropdown → Switch Code Editor tabs → Panel persists
2. ✅ Multiple panel creation → Tab switching → No infinite loops
3. ✅ Editor panels maintain file state across updates

### Theme System Refinements - COMPLETED ✅
- **Fixed Active Tab Styling**: Active tabs now use lighter colors instead of darker ones for better visual hierarchy
- **Fixed Code Editor Empty Area**: Code editor background now properly uses theme CSS variables instead of hardcoded white
- **Fixed Dividers**: All dividers and borders now use theme-aware colors (`--icui-border-subtle`)
- **Improved Scrollbar Readability**: 
  - Increased scrollbar size from 8px to 12px for better visibility
  - Used specific colors for dark themes (#6e7681) and light themes (#d0d7de)
  - Added proper hover states and border styling
- **Fixed Panel Area Theming**: All panel components (headers, content areas) now use CSS variables consistently
- **Fixed Panel Selector Theming**: Dropdown and buttons now use proper theme colors with hover states
- **Reverted Panel Dropdown**: Restored proper fixed positioning dropdown functionality (was accidentally broken)
- **Removed Panel Text**: Kept only the triangle (▼) symbol in panel selector for cleaner UI
- **Updated All Panel Reference Implementations**: 
  - ICUIChatPanel: Added theme CSS variables for all UI elements
  - ICUIExplorerPanel: Added theme CSS variables for file tree and controls
  - ICUIEnhancedEditorPanel: Added theme CSS variables for tabs and editor controls
  - ICUIEditorPanel: Added theme CSS variables and restored syntax highlighting
- **Restored Syntax Highlighting**: Re-added CodeEditor component usage in both editor panels

### ICUI Enhanced Feedback Implementation - COMPLETED ✅
- **Panel Selector UI Enhancement**: Removed the "+ Panel" text and kept only the downward triangle (▼) for cleaner appearance
- **Comprehensive Theme System**: Created `src/icui/styles/themes/icui-themes.css` with 5 distinct themes:
  - **Dark Themes**: GitHub Dark (default), Monokai (classic), One Dark (Atom-inspired)
  - **Light Themes**: GitHub Light (default), VS Code Light (clean)
- **CSS Variables Infrastructure**: Implemented comprehensive CSS variables system covering:
  - Background colors (primary, secondary, tertiary, overlay)
  - Text colors (primary, secondary, muted)
  - Border colors (main, subtle)
  - Accent colors (primary, hover, success, danger, warning)
- **Framework Integration**: Updated all ICUI components to use the new theme system
- **Test Application**: Enhanced `tests/integration/icui/ICUITestEnhanced.tsx` with theme selection dropdown


### Layout System - Panel Footer Attachment Fix
**Issue**: Bottom footer and panel bottoms become detached when browser is resized. The footer doesn't scale together with the panels during browser stretching.

**Root Cause**: The flexbox layout system isn't properly maintaining height constraints through the component tree during browser resize events.

**Solution Approach**:
- Added `maxHeight: '100vh'` to main container to prevent overflow
- Added `max-h-full` to flex-1 layout container for proper constraint propagation
- Updated `ICUIEnhancedLayout` to use `flex flex-col` layout structure
- Made `ICUIFrameContainer` use `flex-1` for proper space filling

**Components Being Updated**:
- `tests/integration/icui/ICUITestEnhanced.tsx`: Main layout container structure
- `src/icui/components/ICUIEnhancedLayout.tsx`: Layout component flex structure
- `src/icui/components/ICUIFrameContainer.tsx`: Frame container height handling

**Expected Behavior**: When browser is resized, panels and footer should scale together maintaining proper attachment at all times.
