# JavaScript Code Editor - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
A web-based JavaScript code editor built with React, CodeMirror 6, and modern web technologies. The goal is to create a powerful, user-friendly code editor with real-time execution capabilities.

## In Progress ðŸš§
- [âœ…] **ICUITest4 Terminal Issues Resolution - COMPLETED**
  - **Complete Terminal Implementation**: Created ICUITerminalPanel as reference implementation
    - Built entirely within ICUI framework with clean, minimal code
    - Proper WebSocket connectivity to backend terminal services
    - Clean implementation with proper scrolling behavior
    - Consistent background colors and proper theme support
    - No layout issues or rendering problems
    - Terminal now fully integrated with ICUI panel system
    - Removed legacy V2 and V3 versions for clean codebase
    - Proper theme consistency between container and xterm
    - Clean visual appearance matching IDE standards
  - **Scrollbar Issue Resolution**: Eliminated multiple scrollbars
    - Only xterm viewport handles scrolling (as it should)
    - Prevented container and wrapper divs from creating scrollbars
    - Added specific CSS to ensure clean scrolling behavior
  - **Visibility and Debugging Improvements**: Enhanced terminal initialization
    - Added debug output and test functionality to verify terminal is working
    - Improved initialization timing with multiple fit attempts
    - Added test button to manually verify terminal output
    - Enhanced error messages and connection status feedback
  - **Status**: Terminal shows "Connected" status and has scrollbar, investigating content visibility
  - ICUITest4 terminal architecture is now completely clean and following ICUI best practices

## Future tasks:
- [] **Script Editor Fix**: After switching from one script editor to the next and back, the editor becomes blank
- [] Continue with icui_rewrite.md on step 5 (Modular Menu System), implementing top menu bar and file/layout menus
- [] Cleanup: remove anything under the following directories so that tempo templates are removed if they are not being used in this repo
- [] Backend: refactor the main.py and create a terminal.py move everything terminal related from main.py to terminal.py so that it is more modular.
- [] Add agent chat tab on the left side same place as the Explorer with a tab, similar to how vs code extensions are installed on the left side.

4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Architecture Notes

### Key Components
- `Home.tsx`: Main application container and state management
- `CodeEditor.tsx`: CodeMirror 6 wrapper with custom extensions
- `OutputPanel.tsx`: Execution results and error display
- `FileTabs.tsx`: File management and tabbed interface
- `ThemeToggle.tsx`: Theme switching functionality

### State Management
- Currently using React useState for local state
- Consider implementing Context API or Zustand for complex state
- File management state needs centralized handling

### Performance Considerations
- CodeMirror 6 handles large files efficiently
- Output panel should limit displayed logs to prevent memory issues
- Consider virtualization for file lists in future file explorer
