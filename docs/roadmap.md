- [] 

## Future tasks:
- [] Backend: refactor the main.py and create a terminal.py move everything terminal related from main.py to terminal.py so that it is more modular.

- [] Add agent chat tab on the left side same place as the Explorer with a tab, similar to how vs code extensions are installed on the left side.

## Recently Finished ðŸŽ‰
- [x] **Updated Development Script to Single-Port Architecture**: Updated start-dev.sh to match production setup:

  - Creating a proper VSCode-like layout with file tabs, editor, and output panel stacked vertically
  - Ensuring the output panel remains collapsible and functional

- âœ… **Fixed cursor disappearing issue**: The cursor would disappear after typing each character, requiring manual mouse clicks to continue typing. This was caused by the CodeMirror editor being recreated on every keystroke. Fixed by:
  - Separating editor initialization from content updates
  - Using transactions to update editor content instead of recreating the entire editor
  - Only recreating the editor when theme changes, not on content changes
  
- âœ… **Added VSCode-like file explorer sidebar**: Implemented a resizable file explorer on the left side with:
  - File tree structure with folders and files
  - File icons based on file extensions
  - Context menu for file operations (create, rename, delete)
  - Resizable panel that can be toggled on/off
  - Integration with existing file tabs system
  - Toggle button in header to show/hide explorer
