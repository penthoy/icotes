# JavaScript Code Editor - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
A web-based JavaScript code editor built with React, CodeMirror 6, and modern web technologies. The goal is to create a powerful, user-friendly code editor with real-time execution capabilities.

## In Progress ðŸš§
- [] Create a reference implementation for the main page, and use this implementation to further develope icui:
1. 

## Future tasks:


- [] create an backend state api layer that is the center of truth for all windows, such as explorer and editor.
- [] Cleanup: remove anything under the following directories so that tempo templates are removed if they are not being used in this repo
- [] Backend: refactor the main.py and create a terminal.py move everything terminal related from main.py to terminal.py so that it is more modular.
- [] Add agent chat tab on the left side same place as the Explorer with a tab, similar to how vs code extensions are installed on the left side.

- [] Continue with icui_rewrite.md on step 5 (Modular Menu System), implementing top menu bar and file/layout menus
## Recently Finished ðŸŽ‰
- [x] **Script Editor Fix**: After switching from one script editor to the next and back, the editor becomes blank

    - Proper theme consistency between container and xterm
    - Clean visual appearance matching IDE standards
  - **Scrollbar Issue Resolution**: Eliminated multiple scrollbars
    - Only xterm viewport handles scrolling (as it should)
    - Prevented container and wrapper divs from creating scrollbars
    - Added specific CSS to ensure clean scrolling behavior
  - **Visibility and Debugging Improvements**: Enhanced terminal initialization
    - Added debug output and test functionality to verify terminal is working
    - Improved initialization timing with multiple fit attempts
    - Added test button to manually verify terminal output
    - Enhanced error messages and connection status feedback
  - **Status**: Terminal shows "Connected" status and has scrollbar, investigating content visibility
  - ICUITest4 terminal architecture is now completely clean and following ICUI best practices

- [âœ…] **Codebase Cleanup and Polish - COMPLETED**
  - **Debug Code Removal**: Cleaned up all development debug code
    - Removed debug console.log statements from ICUITerminalPanel, ICUIEditorPanel, and ICUIExplorerPanel
    - Cleaned up debug console.log in ICUILayoutPresetSelector
    - Preserved production-appropriate error and warning logging
    - Kept development-only debug sections properly guarded with NODE_ENV checks
  - **Development Artifacts Cleanup**: Removed unused development test scripts
    - Removed test-terminal-scroll.py, test-terminal-scroll.sh, test-websocket.py, test-terminal.sh
    - Kept test-connectivity.sh as it's referenced in documentation
    - Cleaned up legacy terminal panel files (V2, V3) that were already removed
  - **Production Readiness**: Verified codebase is clean and production-ready
    - Successful build with no errors
    - All debug code properly managed
    - Clean export structure with single ICUITerminalPanel reference
    - Documentation updated to reflect current state
    - All major development phases completed and polished

- ðŸ“‹ Import/export functionality for code files
- ðŸ“‹ Code sharing and collaboration features

### Developer Experience
- ðŸ“‹ Customizable editor settings and preferences
- ðŸ“‹ Plugin system for extensibility
- ðŸ“‹ Integrated terminal for command execution
- ðŸ“‹ Git integration for version control

### Performance & Optimization
- ðŸ“‹ Large file handling optimization

- ðŸ“‹ Performance monitoring and analytics
- ðŸ“‹ Accessibility improvements (WCAG compliance)

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Code Quality
- ðŸ“‹ Refactor component structure for better maintainability
- ðŸ“‹ Implement proper TypeScript strict mode
- ðŸ“‹ Add comprehensive error handling throughout the app
- ðŸ“‹ Optimize bundle size and loading performance

### Documentation
- ðŸ“‹ API documentation for components

## Current Sprint Focus

### Priority 1: File Management
1. Complete tabbed interface implementation
2. Add file creation and deletion functionality
3. Implement unsaved changes tracking
4. Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+N, Ctrl+S, etc.)

### Priority 2: Enhanced Editor
1. Add search and replace functionality
2. Implement code formatting options
3. Add more language support beyond JavaScript
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Architecture Notes

### Key Components
- `Home.tsx`: Main application container and state management
- `CodeEditor.tsx`: CodeMirror 6 wrapper with custom extensions
- `OutputPanel.tsx`: Execution results and error display
- `FileTabs.tsx`: File management and tabbed interface
- `ThemeToggle.tsx`: Theme switching functionality

### State Management
- Currently using React useState for local state
- Consider implementing Context API or Zustand for complex state
- File management state needs centralized handling

### Performance Considerations
- CodeMirror 6 handles large files efficiently
- Output panel should limit displayed logs to prevent memory issues
- Consider virtualization for file lists in future file explorer
