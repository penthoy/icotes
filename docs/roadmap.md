# JavaScript Code Editor - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
A web-based JavaScript code editor built with React, CodeMirror 6, and modern web technologies. The goal is to create a powerful, user-friendly code editor with real-time execution capabilities.

## In Progress ðŸš§
- [ðŸš§] **ICUI Framework Phase 3 - Panel Docking and Tabbing System**
  - **CRITICAL FOUNDATION FOR IDE FUNCTIONALITY**
  - Implementing docked panel areas with tabbed interfaces
  - Enabling drag-and-drop between panel areas
  - Building the foundation for VS Code-like editor experience
  - Step 3.1: Panel Area Container (âœ… Implemented)
  - Step 3.2: Panel Dock Manager (ðŸš§ Basic implementation)  
  - Step 3.3: Enhanced Panel Dragging (âœ… Tab dragging working)
  - Step 3.4: Integration with Split Panels (âœ… Working)

- [âœ…] continue with icui 2.1 from ui_rewrite.md (Base Panel Component), create a icui-test2 route, so that we don't bog down too much on a single test page.
- [âœ…] create folder that follows indstry standard on test driven development, and put these test files inside. try to follow industry convention as much as possible.

## Future tasks:
- [] Cleanup: remove anything under the following directories so that tempo templates are removed if they are not being used in this repo
- [] Backend: refactor the main.py and create a terminal.py move everything terminal related from main.py to terminal.py so that it is more modular.

- [] Add agent chat tab on the left side same place as the Explorer with a tab, similar to how vs code extensions are installed on the left side.

4. Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+N, Ctrl+S, etc.)

### Priority 2: Enhanced Editor
1. Add search and replace functionality
2. Implement code formatting options
3. Add more language support beyond JavaScript
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Architecture Notes

### Key Components
- `Home.tsx`: Main application container and state management
- `CodeEditor.tsx`: CodeMirror 6 wrapper with custom extensions
- `OutputPanel.tsx`: Execution results and error display
- `FileTabs.tsx`: File management and tabbed interface
- `ThemeToggle.tsx`: Theme switching functionality

### State Management
- Currently using React useState for local state
- Consider implementing Context API or Zustand for complex state
- File management state needs centralized handling

### Performance Considerations
- CodeMirror 6 handles large files efficiently
- Output panel should limit displayed logs to prevent memory issues
- Consider virtualization for file lists in future file explorer
