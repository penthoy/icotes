# JavaScript Code Editor - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
A web-based JavaScript code editor built with React, CodeMirror 6, and modern web technologies. The goal is to create a powerful, user-friendly code editor with real-time execution capabilities.

## In Progress ðŸš§
- [] continue with icui 2.1 from ui_rewrite.md (Base Panel Component)

## Future tasks:
- [] Cleanup: remove anything under the following directories so that tempo templates are removed if they are not being used in this repo
- [] Backend: refactor the main.py and create a terminal.py move everything terminal related from main.py to terminal.py so that it is more modular.

- [] Add agent chat tab on the left side same place as the Explorer with a tab, similar to how vs code extensions are installed on the left side.

    - Reduced minimum panel size from 100px to 2px for unrestricted dragging
    - Added proper animation frame cleanup to prevent memory leaks
    - Optimized state updates to reduce unnecessary re-renders during drag
    - Split panels can now be dragged almost to edges while maintaining grab handle
  - **Rubberband Effect Fix (v1.2.2):**
    - Eliminated rubberband/lag effect during drag operations
    - Implemented conditional CSS transitions (off during drag, on for collapse/expand)
    - Simplified drag handling for instant visual feedback
    - Achieved perfectly smooth and responsive dragging experience
  - Successfully builds and runs without errors
  - All split panel features working robustly with excellent performance

- [âœ…] **ICUI Framework Step 1.3 - Layout State Management**
  - Created comprehensive layout state management system with TypeScript types
  - Implemented persistent storage using localStorage with auto-save functionality
  - Built layout presets system (Default, Code Focused, Terminal Focused)
  - Added export/import functionality for sharing layouts between users
  - Created undo/redo system with configurable history size
  - Developed React hooks for easy integration (useICUILayoutState, useCurrentLayout, useLayoutPresets)
  - Built interactive Layout Preset Selector component with live preview
  - Added proper error handling and loading states
  - Successfully handles layout persistence across browser sessions
  - All features working robustly with excellent user experience

## Current Sprint Focus

### Priority 1: File Management
1. Complete tabbed interface implementation
2. Add file creation and deletion functionality
3. Implement unsaved changes tracking
4. Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+N, Ctrl+S, etc.)

### Priority 2: Enhanced Editor
1. Add search and replace functionality
2. Implement code formatting options
3. Add more language support beyond JavaScript
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Architecture Notes

### Key Components
- `Home.tsx`: Main application container and state management
- `CodeEditor.tsx`: CodeMirror 6 wrapper with custom extensions
- `OutputPanel.tsx`: Execution results and error display
- `FileTabs.tsx`: File management and tabbed interface
- `ThemeToggle.tsx`: Theme switching functionality

### State Management
- Currently using React useState for local state
- Consider implementing Context API or Zustand for complex state
- File management state needs centralized handling

### Performance Considerations
- CodeMirror 6 handles large files efficiently
- Output panel should limit displayed logs to prevent memory issues
- Consider virtualization for file lists in future file explorer
