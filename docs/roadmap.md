- [] Fix Terminal speed issue
- [] Add agent chat tab on the left side same place as the Explorer with a tab, similar to how vs code extensions are installed on the left side.

## Recently Finished ðŸŽ‰
- âœ… **Fixed frontend-backend connection issues**: Resolved connectivity problems between frontend and backend:
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend development server was binding to localhost instead of network IP address
  - **Environment Variables**: Updated scripts to properly load and pass environment variables to Vite
  - **Network Binding**: Frontend now correctly binds to `192.168.2.195:5173` instead of `localhost:5173`
  - **Proxy Configuration**: Verified proxy settings in `vite.config.ts` work correctly with environment variables
  - **Development Scripts**: Created comprehensive `start-dev-env.sh` script with proper environment variable handling
  - **Updated start-dev.sh**: Modified existing script to pass VITE environment variables to frontend
  - **Connection Verification**: Both frontend and backend now properly accessible at configured IP addresses
  - **API Connectivity**: Confirmed `/health`, `/execute`, and WebSocket endpoints work correctly
  - **Production Build**: Environment variables now properly embedded in production builds via `.env.production`

- âœ… **Cleaned up tempo-specific code and dependencies**: Removed all tempo-related code that was not being used in the core project:
  - Removed tempo-devtools import and initialization from `src/main.tsx`
  - Removed tempo-routes import and conditional rendering from `src/App.tsx`
  - Removed tempo-devtools dependency from `package.json`
  - Removed tempo plugin from `vite.config.ts` and cleaned up optimizeDeps
  - Deleted tempo-specific configuration files (`tempo.config.json`, `start-tempo.sh`)
  - Removed tempo-specific documentation (`docs/tempo_deployment.md`)
  - Cleaned up empty `src/tempobook` directory
  - Modified `docs/single_port_solution.md` to remove tempo-specific references while preserving valuable single-port architecture documentation
  - Verified application builds and runs successfully after cleanup
  - Maintained clean, focused codebase for the core JavaScript code editor functionality

- âœ… **Fixed terminal connection for Tempo environment constraint**: Completely resolved WebSocket connection issues in the Tempo remote development environment:
  - **Root Cause Identified**: Application was running in development mode (Vite dev server) while WebSocket tried to connect to same host/port
  - **Production Mode Solution**: Modified default deployment to run production build where FastAPI serves everything on one port  
  - **Single-Port Architecture**: FastAPI backend now serves both React app static files AND WebSocket endpoints
  - **Dynamic URL Construction**: Frontend automatically constructs WebSocket URLs using current page's host/port (`window.location.host`)
  - **Environment Variable Support**: Backend uses PORT environment variable for flexible deployment
  - **Tempo-Specific Scripts**: Created `start-tempo.sh` and updated `npm run dev` for production deployment
  - **Verified Solution**: Tested complete build â†’ deploy â†’ connect workflow successfully
  - **No More Connection Errors**: WebSocket terminals now connect to `wss://your-app.tempo-dev.app/ws/terminal/{id}` correctly
  - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created detailed deployment instructions in `/app/docs/tempo_deployment.md`
- [] Add agent chat tab on the left side same place as the Explorer with a tab, similar to how vs code extensions are installed on the left side.

## Recently Finished ðŸŽ‰

  - Added + icon in the tab panel to create additional tabs
  - Support for both Terminal and Output tab types
  - Closable tabs with X button (except the first terminal tab)
  - Improved tab management with proper state handling
  - Better visual design with hover effects and proper spacing

- âœ… **Implemented a real terminal with PTY support**: Enhanced the terminal functionality with proper PTY-based terminal emulation:
  - Integrated xterm.js for professional terminal emulation in the browser
  - Added backend PTY (pseudoterminal) support using Python's pty module
  - Created WebSocket-based communication between frontend and backend terminal sessions
  - Implemented proper terminal session management with unique terminal IDs
  - Added terminal resizing support and proper cleanup on disconnect
  - Created XTerminal component with connection status indicators and controls
  - Added terminal reconnection capabilities and error handling
  - Integrated terminal into the existing tabbed output panel interface
  - Each terminal session runs in an isolated bash shell environment

- âœ… **Created comprehensive system architecture documentation**: Designed and documented the complete system architecture:
  - Detailed current architecture overview (Vite frontend + FastAPI backend)
  - Component-level architecture diagrams and explanations
  - Data flow documentation with sequence diagrams
  - Security considerations and current limitations
  - Performance optimization strategies
  - Scalability design patterns
  - Future architecture roadmap (v2.0+ with Rust backend)
  - Deployment architecture and production considerations
  - Technology decision rationale and trade-offs
  - Monitoring and observability planning

- âœ… **Added FastAPI backend with WebSocket support**: Created a complete backend infrastructure:
  - FastAPI server with CORS support for cross-origin requests
  - Real-time WebSocket communication for code execution
  - REST API endpoints for code execution and health monitoring
  - Python code execution with output and error capture
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Connection management and reconnection logic
  - Fallback from WebSocket to REST API if connection fails

- âœ… **Created WebSocket frontend integration**: Enhanced frontend with real-time backend communication:
  - CodeExecutor utility class with WebSocket and REST API support
  - Automatic connection management and reconnection logic
  - Real-time code execution with proper error handling
  - Execution time tracking and performance monitoring
  - Seamless fallback between WebSocket and REST API
  - Updated UI with execution status indicators

- âœ… **Made the terminal resizable**: Enhanced the terminal/output panel with vertical resizing capabilities:
  - Created VerticalResizablePanel component for vertical resizing functionality
  - Added drag handle at the top of the terminal panel for resizing
  - Configurable minimum height (100px) and maximum height (600px)
  - Smooth mouse interaction with proper cursor changes during resize
  - Integrated resizable panel into the main layout while maintaining existing functionality
  - Terminal can now be resized vertically by dragging the top border

- âœ… **Added proper terminal with tabs in output area**: Implemented a VSCode-like tabbed interface for the bottom panel with:
  - Output tab: Shows code execution results and errors (existing functionality)
  - Terminal tab: Interactive command-line interface with:
    - Command history (up/down arrows)
    - Built-in commands (help, clear, echo, date)
    - Terminal-style UI with green text on black background
    - Proper scrolling and auto-focus
  - Tabbed interface with smooth switching between Output and Terminal
  - Consistent styling and theme integration

- âœ… **Added Python support as default language**: Enhanced the code editor with multi-language support:

  - Added language detection based on file extensions (.py, .js, .jsx)
  - Automatic language switching when switching between files
  - Python code execution simulation (basic print statement parsing)
  - Updated new file creation to default to Python (.py extension)
  - Proper Python syntax highlighting and code completion

- âœ… **Fixed Output panel layout**: The output panel was incorrectly positioned to the right of the code editor horizontally. Fixed by:
  - Restructuring the layout to position the output panel below the code editor vertically
  - Maintaining the explorer sidebar on the left
  - Creating a proper VSCode-like layout with file tabs, editor, and output panel stacked vertically
  - Ensuring the output panel remains collapsible and functional

- âœ… **Fixed cursor disappearing issue**: The cursor would disappear after typing each character, requiring manual mouse clicks to continue typing. This was caused by the CodeMirror editor being recreated on every keystroke. Fixed by:
  - Separating editor initialization from content updates
  - Using transactions to update editor content instead of recreating the entire editor
  - Only recreating the editor when theme changes, not on content changes
  
- âœ… **Added VSCode-like file explorer sidebar**: Implemented a resizable file explorer on the left side with:
  - File tree structure with folders and files
  - File icons based on file extensions
  - Context menu for file operations (create, rename, delete)
  - Resizable panel that can be toggled on/off
  - Integration with existing file tabs system
  - Toggle button in header to show/hide explorer
