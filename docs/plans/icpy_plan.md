# ICPI Backend Implementation Plan - Modular Event-Driven Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for rewriting the icotes backend into a modular, event-driven architecture that serves as a single source of truth for the frontend. The new system will provide a unified API layer accessible via WebSocket, HTTP, and CLI interfaces, enabling real-time collaboration between frontend components and external tools including AI agents.

## Mission Statement
Create a backend that acts as a **single source of truth** for the frontend, is highly performant, modular, and built for extensibility. The architecture will support real-time updates across all connected clients and provide seamless integration for AI tools and command-line interfaces through the `icpy` command.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Backend maintains the authoritative state for all workspace elements
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicate asynchronously via a central message broker
3. **Unified API Layer**: Single protocol for WebSocket, HTTP, and CLI access enabling commands like `icotes file.py`
4. **Modular Services**: Independent, swappable service components with clear boundaries
5. **Real-time Synchronization**: Immediate state updates across all clients and tools
6. **Extensible Design**: Easy addition of new services (future rich text editor, AI agents) without rewrites
7. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive integration tests for each phase

## Current Backend Analysis

### Existing Structure
- **FastAPI Application**: Monolithic server in `backend/icpy/main.py` (788 lines)
- **Terminal Management**: PTY-based terminal sessions in `backend/icpy/terminal.py` (305 lines)
- **Clipboard System**: Server-side clipboard with system integration
- **Code Execution**: Python code execution with output capture
- **WebSocket Support**: Basic WebSocket endpoints for terminal and general communication

### Current Limitations
- Monolithic structure with tight coupling between components
- No unified communication protocol for different client types
- Limited service separation - all functionality in main.py
- No event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- No CLI interface for external tool integration
- No real-time state synchronization across clients
- Difficult to extend with new features (rich text editor, AI agents)
