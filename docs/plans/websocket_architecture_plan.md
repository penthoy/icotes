# WebSocket Architecture Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Endpoints
1. `/ws` - Centralized service (File operations, Explorer, code execution, general messaging)
2. `/ws/terminal/{id}` - Direct terminal connection
3. `/ws/chat` - Direct chat/AI agent connection (**NOT a duplicate**)

### Issues Identified
1. **Inconsistent Connection Management** - Terminal waits for centralized service âœ… FIXED
2. **Service Overlap Confusion** - Need to clarify which service handles what
3. **Multiple Connections Per Client** - Resource overhead (acceptable for now)
4. **Complex Error Handling** - Different failure modes per connection

## Service Responsibilities Clarified

After analysis, the endpoints are **NOT duplicates** but serve different purposes:

### `/ws` (Centralized Service)
- **File operations** (read, write, list directories)
- **Code execution** (Python, JavaScript)
- **JSON-RPC protocol** support
- **Explorer functionality** (file browsing)
- **System notifications**
- **Generic pub/sub messaging**

### `/ws/chat` (Dedicated Chat Service)  
- **AI agent conversations**
- **Real-time chat streaming**
- **Chat history management**
- **Agent configuration**
- **Custom agent interactions**

### `/ws/terminal/{id}` (Dedicated Terminal Service)
- **Direct PTY communication**
- **Binary terminal data**
- **Low-latency I/O**
- **Terminal resizing**
- **Shell command execution**

## Recommended Hybrid Architecture

### Service Classification

#### High-Performance Direct Connections
**Use dedicated endpoints for performance-critical services:**

- **`/ws/terminal/{id}`** - Keep direct for low-latency I/O
  - Binary data support
  - Direct PTY communication
  - Independent from other services
  
- **`/ws/file-stream/{operation_id}`** - For large file operations
  - File uploads/downloads
  - Binary file content
  - Progress streaming

#### Unified Message-Based Connection
**Use centralized endpoint for request/response patterns:**

- **`/ws`** - Enhanced centralized service
  - Chat/AI messages
  - File CRUD operations
  - Directory listing
  - System notifications
  - Service status updates

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Update Documentation âœ… COMPLETED  
1. ~~Remove `/ws/chat` endpoint (use `/ws` instead)~~ **NOT NEEDED - Services are distinct**
2. ~~Consolidate chat functionality in centralized service~~ **NOT NEEDED - Chat has dedicated service**
3. Document service responsibilities clearly âœ… DONE

#### Phase 2: Improve Connection Independence âœ… COMPLETED
1. Make terminal connection truly independent âœ… DONE
2. Remove terminal dependency on centralized service status âœ… DONE  
3. Add separate connection status tracking per service âœ… IMPLEMENTED

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Message Routing
1. Implement proper message typing in centralized service
2. Add connection pooling and load balancing
3. Implement message prioritization

## Frontend Connection Strategy

### Connection Manager Pattern
```typescript
class ConnectionManager {
  private mainConnection: WebSocket;      // /ws - chat, files, notifications
  private terminalConnections: Map<string, WebSocket>; // /ws/terminal/{id}
  private fileStreamConnections: Map<string, WebSocket>; // /ws/file-stream/{id}
  
  // Independent connection status per service
  getConnectionStatus(service: 'main' | 'terminal' | 'file-stream'): ConnectionStatus;
  
  // Service-specific connection methods
  connectTerminal(terminalId: string): Promise<WebSocket>;
  connectFileStream(operationId: string): Promise<WebSocket>;
  connectMain(): Promise<WebSocket>;
}
```

### Benefits of Hybrid Approach
1. **Performance** - Direct connections for high-throughput services
2. **Consistency** - Unified connection for standard operations  
3. **Independence** - Services can fail independently
4. **Scalability** - Can optimize each connection type separately
5. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing terminal code works unchanged

## Migration Plan

### Step 1: Audit Current Usage
- [ ] Map all WebSocket endpoints and their usage
- [ ] Identify duplicate functionality
- [ ] Document current connection dependencies

### Step 2: ~~Consolidate Chat Services~~ **NOT NEEDED**
- [x] **Analysis Complete** - `/ws/chat` serves distinct purpose from `/ws`
- [x] **Services Clarified** - Chat service handles AI agents, centralized service handles files/code
- [x] **No Consolidation Required** - Each service optimized for its use case

### Step 3: ~~Fix Terminal Independence~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] Remove terminal dependency on centralized service  
- [x] Add separate terminal connection status tracking
- [x] Implement robust terminal reconnection

### Step 4: Implement Architecture Improvements ðŸš€ **RECOMMENDED**
- [ ] **Unified Connection Manager** - Centralize connection logic across all services
- [ ] **Standardized Error Handling** - Consistent error types and recovery strategies  
- [ ] **Performance Optimizations** - Message batching, connection pooling
- [ ] **Health Monitoring** - Real-time connection diagnostics
- [ ] **Developer Experience** - Debug dashboard, better logging

## Success Metrics
1. **Latency** - Terminal response time < 10ms
2. **Reliability** - 99.9% connection uptime per service
3. **Resource Usage** - Reduce total connections by 30%
4. **Error Recovery** - Independent service recovery
5. **Developer Experience** - Clear connection status per service

## Conclusion âœ… **ANALYSIS COMPLETE**

**The current architecture is well-designed and NOT problematic:**

1. **`/ws/chat` is NOT a duplicate** - It's a specialized service for AI agent interactions
2. **Each service serves distinct purposes** - Files/code vs Chat vs Terminal
3. **Performance trade-offs are appropriate** - Direct connections for high-performance services
4. **The terminal connection issue was implementation, not architecture** âœ… FIXED

**Current Status: Architecture is sound, terminal connection fixed, no major changes needed.**
