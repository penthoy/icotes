## Issues:

The catch-all route @app.get("/{path:path}") is intercepting /api/files requests and serving the React HTML instead of letting the API routes handle them!

This is a common FastAPI issue where the catch-all route for serving the SPA (Single Page App) intercepts API routes. The catch-all route needs to be registered AFTER all the API routes, but here it's probably being registered AFTER the icpy REST API routes.
