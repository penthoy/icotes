# Terminal Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
The terminal was trying to connect to `ws://localhost:8000` which doesn't work in the Tempo remote development environment because only port 80 is exposed. The connection failed with network errors.

## Solution Implemented
Following the code-server architecture analysis, implemented a proxy/broker pattern where:

1. **Single Port Architecture**: Both the React app and WebSocket endpoints are served from the same port
2. **Dynamic WebSocket URLs**: Frontend constructs WebSocket URLs based on the current host/port
3. **Development Proxy**: Vite proxy configuration handles WebSocket routing during development
4. **Production Serving**: FastAPI serves both the built React app and handles WebSocket connections

## Key Changes Made

### Backend (`/app/backend/main.py`)
- Added static file serving for the built React app
- Added proper route handling for both API and frontend routes
- WebSocket terminal endpoint remains the same but now accessible from same port

### Frontend (`/app/src/components/XTerminal.tsx`)
- Updated WebSocket URL construction to use `window.location.host` 
- Removed hardcoded localhost:8000 references
- Added proper connection logging

### Development Setup (`/app/vite.config.ts`)
- Added proxy configuration for WebSocket (`/ws`) and API routes
- Ensures seamless development experience with both frontend and backend

### Build Configuration (`/app/package.json`)
- Added production start script
- Added development backend script

## Testing Results
- ✅ Backend health check passes
- ✅ WebSocket endpoint is accessible
- ✅ Frontend development server works
- ✅ Production build serves correctly
- ✅ WebSocket terminal connection works (verified with test client)
- ✅ PTY integration functioning properly
- ✅ Terminal sessions create and clean up correctly

## Architecture Benefits
1. **Single Port**: Works in restricted environments like Tempo
2. **Development Friendly**: Vite proxy handles routing transparently
3. **Production Ready**: FastAPI serves everything from one port
4. **Scalable**: Can easily add more WebSocket endpoints or API routes

## Next Steps
This terminal implementation now works in both development and production environments, and specifically addresses the Tempo constraint of only having port 80 exposed. The connection should work reliably in the remote development server.
