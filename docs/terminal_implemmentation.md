The Core Concept

A pseudoterminal (PTY) on the backend connected to an in-browser terminal emulator on the frontend via a WebSocket.

Frontend: xterm.js receives user keystrokes and sends them down the WebSocket. It also receives output from the WebSocket and renders it.

Backend: A PTY process is spawned (e.g., running bash). It pipes its input/output to/from the WebSocket.

Frontend (Vite + Your Framework)

Library: Use xterm.js. It's the industry standard (VS Code uses it).

Implementation:

Create a WebSocket connection to your backend (e.g., ws://localhost:8000/ws/terminal).

Initialize xterm.js and attach it to a DOM element.

Bridge the connection:

xterm.onData(data => ws.send(data)) // Send keystrokes to backend.

ws.onmessage = event => xterm.write(event.data) // Write backend output to terminal.

Sizing: Use xterm-addon-fit to make the terminal dimensions match its container. Send the new cols/rows to the backend over the WebSocket so the PTY can be resized.

Backend (FastAPI)

This is where the isolation happens. Each terminal connection spawns its own isolated shell process.

Library: Python's built-in pty and os modules. No external dependencies needed.

Implementation:

Create a WebSocket endpoint: @app.websocket("/ws/terminal").

On connection, use pty.fork(). This creates a child process.

In the child process, execute a shell: os.execv("/bin/bash", ["/bin/bash"]).

In the parent process (your FastAPI app), you now have the PTY's master file descriptor (master_fd).

Use asyncio to create two concurrent tasks:

Task 1 (Read from PTY): Asynchronously read from master_fd and send the data over the WebSocket to the frontend.

Task 2 (Write to PTY): Asynchronously receive data from the WebSocket and write it to master_fd.

How code-server Does It

They do the exact same thing.

Frontend: xterm.js.

Backend: Node.js.

The "Magic": They use the node-pty library, which is just a Node.js wrapper around the same system-level PTY functionality you'll be using in Python (or Rust). The principle is identical.

Future Rust Migration

This architecture makes migration easy. The frontend doesn't change at all.

You'll replace the FastAPI WebSocket endpoint with one in your Rust framework (e.g., Axum, Actix-web).

You'll replace the Python pty module calls with a Rust PTY crate like pty-process.

The logic remains the same: spawn a shell, get the PTY file descriptors, and bridge I/O with the WebSocket.
