## In Progress ðŸš§

### File Management System
- ðŸš§ VS Code-like tabbed interface for multiple files
- ðŸš§ File creation, renaming, and deletion
- ðŸš§ File modification tracking (unsaved changes indicator)
- ðŸš§ Keyboard shortcuts for file operations

### Enhanced Editor Features
- ðŸš§ Multiple language support (currently JavaScript only)
- ðŸš§ Advanced code formatting and linting
- ðŸš§ Search and replace functionality
- ðŸš§ Code minimap for navigation

## Planned Features ðŸ“‹

### Advanced Functionality
- ðŸ“‹ File tree/explorer sidebar
- ðŸ“‹ Project workspace management
- ðŸ“‹ Import/export functionality for code files
- ðŸ“‹ Code sharing and collaboration features

### Developer Experience
- ðŸ“‹ Customizable editor settings and preferences
- ðŸ“‹ Plugin system for extensibility
- ðŸ“‹ Integrated terminal for command execution
- ðŸ“‹ Git integration for version control

### Performance & Optimization
- ðŸ“‹ Large file handling optimization
- ðŸ“‹ Lazy loading for better performance
- ðŸ“‹ Offline functionality with service workers
- ðŸ“‹ Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities

### Testing & Quality
- ðŸ“‹ Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- ðŸ“‹ End-to-end testing with Playwright
- ðŸ“‹ Performance monitoring and analytics
- ðŸ“‹ Accessibility improvements (WCAG compliance)

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Code Quality
- ðŸ“‹ Refactor component structure for better maintainability
- ðŸ“‹ Implement proper TypeScript strict mode
- ðŸ“‹ Add comprehensive error handling throughout the app
- ðŸ“‹ Optimize bundle size and loading performance

### Documentation
- ðŸ“‹ API documentation for components
- ðŸ“‹ User guide and tutorials
- ðŸ“‹ Contributing guidelines for open source
- ðŸ“‹ Deployment and hosting documentation

## Current Sprint Focus

### Priority 1: File Management
1. Complete tabbed interface implementation
2. Add file creation and deletion functionality
3. Implement unsaved changes tracking
4. Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+N, Ctrl+S, etc.)

### Priority 2: Enhanced Editor
1. Add search and replace functionality
2. Implement code formatting options
3. Add more language support beyond JavaScript
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Architecture Notes

### Key Components
- `Home.tsx`: Main application container and state management
- `CodeEditor.tsx`: CodeMirror 6 wrapper with custom extensions
- `OutputPanel.tsx`: Execution results and error display
- `FileTabs.tsx`: File management and tabbed interface
- `ThemeToggle.tsx`: Theme switching functionality

### State Management
- Currently using React useState for local state
- Consider implementing Context API or Zustand for complex state
- File management state needs centralized handling

### Performance Considerations
- CodeMirror 6 handles large files efficiently
- Output panel should limit displayed logs to prevent memory issues
- Consider virtualization for file lists in future file explorer
