# JavaScript Code Editor - Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
A web-based JavaScript code editor built with React, CodeMirror 6, and modern web technologies. The goal is to create a powerful, user-friendly code editor with real-time execution capabilities.

## In Progress 🚧
(No tasks currently in progress)

## Future tasks:
- [] Add a proper terminal in the same output area with tabs similar to vs code UI
- [] Add A fastapi backend.
- [] add an agent chat tab on the left side same place as the Explorer.

## Recently Finished 🎉
- ✅ **Fixed Output panel layout**: The output panel was incorrectly positioned to the right of the code editor horizontally. Fixed by:
  - Restructuring the layout to position the output panel below the code editor vertically
  - Maintaining the explorer sidebar on the left
  - Creating a proper VSCode-like layout with file tabs, editor, and output panel stacked vertically
  - Ensuring the output panel remains collapsible and functional

- ✅ **Fixed cursor disappearing issue**: The cursor would disappear after typing each character, requiring manual mouse clicks to continue typing. This was caused by the CodeMirror editor being recreated on every keystroke. Fixed by:
  - Separating editor initialization from content updates
  - Using transactions to update editor content instead of recreating the entire editor
  - Only recreating the editor when theme changes, not on content changes
  
- ✅ **Added VSCode-like file explorer sidebar**: Implemented a resizable file explorer on the left side with:
  - File tree structure with folders and files
  - File icons based on file extensions
  - Context menu for file operations (create, rename, delete)
  - Resizable panel that can be toggled on/off
  - Integration with existing file tabs system
  - Toggle button in header to show/hide explorer

## Completed Features ✅

### Core Editor Functionality
- ✅ CodeMirror 6 integration with syntax highlighting
- ✅ JavaScript code execution with console output capture
- ✅ Real-time error handling and display
- ✅ Code completion and bracket matching
- ✅ Line numbers and code folding

### User Interface
- ✅ Clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Light/dark theme toggle with system preference detection
- ✅ Collapsible output panel for execution results
- ✅ Professional header with branding and controls

### Technical Infrastructure
- ✅ Vite build system with React and TypeScript
- ✅ ShadCN UI component library integration
- ✅ Proper error boundary and handling
- ✅ Tempo platform integration for development

### File Management System
- 🚧 VS Code-like tabbed interface for multiple files
- 🚧 File creation, renaming, and deletion
- 🚧 File modification tracking (unsaved changes indicator)
- 🚧 Keyboard shortcuts for file operations

### Enhanced Editor Features
- 🚧 Multiple language support (currently JavaScript only)
- 🚧 Advanced code formatting and linting
- 🚧 Search and replace functionality
- 🚧 Code minimap for navigation

## Planned Features 📋

### Advanced Functionality
- 📋 File tree/explorer sidebar
- 📋 Project workspace management
- 📋 Import/export functionality for code files
- 📋 Code sharing and collaboration features

### Developer Experience
- 📋 Customizable editor settings and preferences
- 📋 Plugin system for extensibility
- 📋 Integrated terminal for command execution
- 📋 Git integration for version control

### Performance & Optimization
- 📋 Large file handling optimization
- 📋 Lazy loading for better performance
- 📋 Offline functionality with service workers
- 📋 Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities

### Testing & Quality
- 📋 Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- 📋 End-to-end testing with Playwright
- 📋 Performance monitoring and analytics
- 📋 Accessibility improvements (WCAG compliance)

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Code Quality
- 📋 Refactor component structure for better maintainability
- 📋 Implement proper TypeScript strict mode
- 📋 Add comprehensive error handling throughout the app
- 📋 Optimize bundle size and loading performance

### Documentation
- 📋 API documentation for components
- 📋 User guide and tutorials
- 📋 Contributing guidelines for open source
- 📋 Deployment and hosting documentation

## Current Sprint Focus

### Priority 1: File Management
1. Complete tabbed interface implementation
2. Add file creation and deletion functionality
3. Implement unsaved changes tracking
4. Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+N, Ctrl+S, etc.)

### Priority 2: Enhanced Editor
1. Add search and replace functionality
2. Implement code formatting options
3. Add more language support beyond JavaScript
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Architecture Notes

### Key Components
- `Home.tsx`: Main application container and state management
- `CodeEditor.tsx`: CodeMirror 6 wrapper with custom extensions
- `OutputPanel.tsx`: Execution results and error display
- `FileTabs.tsx`: File management and tabbed interface
- `ThemeToggle.tsx`: Theme switching functionality

### State Management
- Currently using React useState for local state
- Consider implementing Context API or Zustand for complex state
- File management state needs centralized handling

### Performance Considerations
- CodeMirror 6 handles large files efficiently
- Output panel should limit displayed logs to prevent memory issues
- Consider virtualization for file lists in future file explorer
